# Even More Text Plates

An extension for Earendel's [Text Plates](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/textplates/). Adds plastic plates (white and player-coloured) and more.

Based on Deadlock's [More Text Plates](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DeadlockMoreTextPlates/) mod.

### 1.1.0 update:
Now with the orginial Text Plates font, to be more in line with what it extends. Special thanks to Earendel for the font source files and all the help and guidance he provided! <3

There is an option to enable the old graphics, in courtesy of Deadlock989. This applies only to both plastic types.

### 1.2.x updates:
Finally more variants. I will, if time permits, add new variants slowly over time. Starting with..... Wood!
