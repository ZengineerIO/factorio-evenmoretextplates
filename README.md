# Even More Text Plates

An extension for Earendel's [Text Plates](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/textplates). Adds only plastic plates (white and player-coloured) *for now*.

Based on Deadlock's [More Text Plates](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DeadlockMoreTextPlates) mod.

### 1.1.0 update:
Now with the orginial Text Plates font. Special thanks to Earendel for the font source files and all the help and guidance he provided! <3

There is an option the enable the old graphics in courtesy of Deadlock989, this applies only to both plastic types. *(future proof)*
